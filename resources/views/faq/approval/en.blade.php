    <x-h2 >What is approval?</x-h2>
    <p class="mb-5">Approval is for us to know that you are a real restaurant.</p>

    <x-h2>Why should my restaurant be approved?</x-h2>
    <p>If your restaurant is not approved your possibilities are severly limited,
        you are <i>not</i> going to be able to use such crucial features as:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2 mb-5">
        <li class="list-disc ml-5">Having your restaurant be discoverable to potential customers</li>
        <li class="list-disc ml-5">Be able to make reservations</li>
    </ul>

    <x-h2>How do I get approved?</x-h2>
    <p>Send us an email to <x-a href="mailto:support@foo.com">support@foo.com</x-a>
        with a proof of the restaurant ownership and we will respond within 24 hours of a business day.</p>
